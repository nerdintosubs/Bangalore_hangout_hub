# Review & Referral Links (templates)

## Google Review Link
- Base (replace with your live Place ID link): `https://g.page/r/REPLACE_WITH_PLACE_ID/review`
- With UTM for tracking when shared: `https://g.page/r/REPLACE_WITH_PLACE_ID/review?utm_source=wa&utm_medium=review-ask&utm_campaign=post-session`
- WhatsApp quick-reply snippet: “Thanks for choosing BLR Hangout Hub! If you liked the experience, a quick Google review helps a lot: <link>”

## Referral Share Link (WhatsApp)
- Direct WA chat with UTM: `https://wa.me/9187351205?text=Hi%2C%20I%27d%20like%20to%20book%20a%20session.%20src%3Dreferral&utm_source=referral&utm_medium=wa&utm_campaign=friendshare`
- Share text suggestion: “Safe, at-home massage by female, KYC-verified therapists. Transparent pricing. Book them on WhatsApp: <referral link>”

## Bio/GBP Appointment Links (UTM examples)
- IG/FB bio: `https://wa.me/9187351205?text=Hi%2C%20I%27d%20like%20to%20book.%20src%3Dig-bio&utm_source=ig&utm_medium=bio&utm_campaign=always-on`

## Notes
- Keep UTMs consistent (`utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`). See `docs/utm-schema.md`.
- Update the review link with your actual Google Business Profile review URL once available.
