# Growth Playbook (WhatsApp-First, Local, Luxury/Safe Positioning)

## Goals & Guardrails
- Primary: +40–60% qualified WhatsApp conversations in 90 days.
- Secondary: review velocity (GBP), social proof, Meta CTR to WA.
- Guardrails: luxury + safe; “massage by female therapists only”; no deep discounts that cheapen the brand.

## 30-Day Sprint (Foundation)
- NAP consistency: `BLR Hangout Hub`, phone/WA `+9187351205`, service areas (Koramangala, Indiranagar, HSR, Jayanagar, Whitefield).
- Profiles: Create/verify Google Business Profile (GBP), Instagram, Facebook. Add WA CTA links with UTM (`?src=ig_bio`, `?src=fb_page`, `?src=gbp`).
- Review loop: Post-session WA template with Google review link + short CTA; reply to all reviews <24h.
- Media: Upload 15 photos + 2 short clips to GBP (safety, therapist professionalism, home setup).
- Content starter kit: 4 Reels (booking journey, safety/consent, luxury setup, zone ETA), 4 carousels (pricing, therapist standards, FAQ, zone spotlight).

## Day-to-Day Cadence (Ongoing)
- Posts: 3–4/week (2 Reels, 1–2 carousels/testimonials). Cross-post IG→FB.
- Stories: daily—availability note (“we confirm on WhatsApp”), pricing, testimonial screenshots.
- GBP: 1 post/week; answer Q&A weekly; keep media fresh monthly.
- WA quick replies: pricing, zones, prep checklist, review request, safety policy.

## 60-Day Layer (Experiment & Scale)
- Meta Click-to-WhatsApp ads: radius targeting around top zones; 2 angles—(a) safety + female therapists only, (b) transparent pricing. Optimize on 7-day WA replies.
- Retargeting: site visitors + IG engagers + WA clickers.
- Referral flywheel: “Bring a friend” WA share link with fixed perk; track via UTM.
- Partnerships: gyms, women-focused co-working, apartment communities; co-branded “first session” perks.

## 90-Day Layer (Automation & Moats)
- Automation:
  - GA4 events on all WA CTAs + UTM ingestion; weekly performance sheet (clicks, WA replies, CPL).
  - Google Sheet + Apps Script to generate weekly captions for IG/FB/GBP (themes: safety, pricing, zones, testimonials).
  - Review ask automation via WA template after each session.
- SEO/Content:
  - Monthly zone spotlight posts on-site (Koramangala, Indiranagar, HSR, Jayanagar, Whitefield) with WA CTA + local keywords.
  - Structured data: LocalBusiness, Service, FAQPage, (optional) Review when real reviews exist.
- GBP growth: Target 30–50 new reviews in 90 days; keep adding media monthly.

## Tracking & KPIs
- Primary: WA clicks & reply rate; cost/WA conversation (ads).
- Secondary: review count & response time (GBP), GBP actions (calls/WA), IG/FB profile clicks, saves/shares.
- Reporting: weekly 15-min snapshot; monthly strategy tweak.

## Templates to prepare
- UTM scheme: `?src={channel}_{placement}` (examples: `ig_bio`, `fb_post`, `gbp_post`, `meta_c2w`).
- WA quick replies: pricing, zones, prep checklist, safety, review request, referral share link.
- GBP post templates: offer, zone spotlight, safety policy, testimonial snippet.
- Caption bank: 12–16 prompts (safety, luxury at home, therapist standards, transparent pricing, zone ETAs).
